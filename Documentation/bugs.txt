Current Bugs
--------------------------------------
- A small (1-3) number of enemies on each floor are unattackable.
- Enemies can randomly move into the same tile as each other, so that it appears that 
	there is one of them, but there's actually 2. (Andy)
- Enemies can randomly move into the same tile as the player and not damage him. (Andy)



Fixed Bugs
--------------------------------------
- A small number of enemies on each floor do not move. - Fixed 4/22/2013 (Royse)
- Seems like the more floors you go down, the more enemies there are, even though
	there should be the same amount of enemies on each floor 
	for now - Fixed 4/22/2013 (Andy)
